This is a merge with the master branch not hosted on GitHub - a lot of the changes are irrelevant to the AWS F1 or
simulation backends. That said, there are some significant changes for the simulation backend.

1. You can simulate memory transactions more authentically by building cmake build with -DTARGET=sim -DUSE_DRAMSIM=1
   Previously this build system existed but wasn't fully realistic and also had a rare race condition that was triggered
   under high memory contention. Now works. There may be significant performance decline though. Lots of locking.

2. Flush trace file on kill signals. If there are some fringe signals that I've left out, you can add them to the signal
   handler as I did on src/verilator.cc:895,896.

3. Use -DVERBOSE=1 to turn on more debug messages. Suggested for simulation builds.
