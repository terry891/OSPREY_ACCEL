- Resolved error on some platforms where interleaved memory transactions resulted in undefined behavior
- Removed finish_early/stop from writer/reader interfaces. Added in_progress flag to reader which should be more intuitive
- Remove support for emitting transactions in one burst. This was causing some ordering issues.
    Have to use other method for prefetching now.
- Examples now reflect above changes
- Resolve issue where cores were misaddressed when using many systems
