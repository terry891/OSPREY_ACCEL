 * AW - Write address port \n
 * W - Write data port \n
 * B - Write response port \n
 * AR - Read address port \n
 * R - Read response port \n
 *
 * Composer counts the number of responses for each one of these ports for debugging purposes (presumably)
 * Composer also collects the number of cycles spent waiting for read responses(21) and for write responses(22)
